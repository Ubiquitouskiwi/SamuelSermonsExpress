# SamuelSermonsExpress
Express.js version of the static website Samuel Sermons

# Development
These are the steps to start development on this website.

```
git clone https://github.com/Ubiquitouskiwi/SamuelSermonsExpress.git
cd SamuelSermonsExpress
npm install
```

Now you will have the project cloned and all the dependencies installed. To run the 
test server we use nodemon so we can watch for changes in the project and reload the
server to pick up those changes. To start this dev server you run

```
npm run serverstart
```

>The option devstart will set the DEBUG environmnet varibale and then start the app
>nodemon

Now you can begin making changes and testing them on the dev server.
