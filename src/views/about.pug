              p.lead.mb-4
                | This website is dedicated to the memory of my grandfather, Samuel Starling, a dedicated minister whose 
                | wisdom, kindness, and spiritual guidance touched countless lives through the Methodist church.
              
              p.mb-4
                | When he passed away, he left behind a treasure trove of sermonsâ€”carefully crafted teachings spanning decades, 
                | with some dating back to the 1980s. These sermons are more than just words on paper; they reflect his deep desire 
                | to uplift, guide, and offer hope to others.

              p.mb-4
                | As I work through this collection, I'm reconnecting with who he was and the values he held dear. 
                | This project is a labor of love; an effort to preserve his legacy and share his wisdom 
                | with those who knew him and those who never had the chance to meet him.

              p
                | Samuel was always willing to help others, and it feels fitting that his words might continue to 
                | offer comfort, insight, and spiritual guidance, just as they did during his lifetime.
